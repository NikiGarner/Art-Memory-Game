## Description
This is a memory game with art from different periods. The user clicks on which period they would like and then tries to correctly match the pieces of art. While the user is finding matches there is a counter at the top that keeps track of the users clicks. Once the user has succesfully found all the matches all art pieces will be displayed with the paintings name and artist.
